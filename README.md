# ment-ai README

Ment.ai extension provide you an easy way to start using chatGPT in your daily work, and for your different learning purposes.

> :warning: Since ChatGPT API isn't publicly available we will need you to connect to your OpenAI account. Note that your login credentials will never be shared and will only send to OpenAI login API, to allow you to access ChatGPT.
> As the owner of the account, you are responsible for the data you send to OpenAI and for how you use their services.

# Features

Use the Command palette (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and use one of the following commands:

## Init profile

> Ment.ai: Setup OpenAI account

You will be prompt an input box where you need to specify your email, and password. We don't yet other login methods.

We use [PyChatGPT](https://github.com/rawandahmad698/PyChatGPT) to make the initialize the connection and generate the access token. We will automatically install it on your machine and running locally without proxy (see [src/openai.ts:15](src/openai.ts:15)).

## Start course

> Ment.ai: Set new goal

You will need to specify a goal you want to achieve, so ChatGPT can generate you the appropriated exercise. It might take ~5-10seconds.

You can start a new goal at any point, see in the `~/mentai/courses` folder the list of courses you did.

We added a list of interesting goal to start with: [GOALS_README.md](GOALS_README.md)

## Next exercise

> Ment.ai: Next exercise

When you feel like you explore everything on the exercise topic, you can try another one, by using this command. The subject will remain focus on your current goal.

## Submit answer

Once you received your exercise, depending on the type, you will be able to submit an answer to progress and see what ChatGPT has to offer you next. 2 types of answers are possible Text & Code.

### Text

> Ment.ai: Answer/Submit exercise

It will prompt you an input box where you can write the sentence. _Note: you can use Markdown and LaTeX_

### Code

> Ment.ai: Answer/Submit with code

You will need to be in the file you want to submit. If you select a part of the code you can only submit that.

## Request solution

> Ment.ai: Answer/Submit with code

## Others

- With a file open in the editor you can use the following command to get some help by ChatGPT.
  - **"Ment.ai: Ask ChatGPT"**
    > Request: 'Ask anything.'
  - **"Ment.ai: Why is my code broken?"**
    > Request: 'Why is this code broken?'
  - **"Ment.ai: Explain this code"**
    > Request: 'Can you explain what this code does?'
  - **"Ment.ai: Refactor this code"**
    > Request: 'Can you refactor this code and explain what's changed?'

If you select the a part of the code it will be append only that to the request otherwise it will send the all file.

- **"Ment.ai: Clear ChatGPT Logs"**
  - You can clear the logs:

## Requirements

:warning: you must have `python=>3.9` installed on your local machine. If you don't you can use the following tutorial to do so.

## Extension Settings

None

## Known Issues

- For the moment as describe in this issue, the connection will be only available for email/password login flow. Google and Microsoft signup flow isn't yet implemented.
  - https://github.com/rawandahmad698/PyChatGPT/issues/3
- You will probably encounter issue on the content generated by ChatGPT (e.g. inconsistency, functions hallucination, etc.). It's normal, nothing perfect, but we hope the tool will be useful in some place.
- If you leave a learning session, the next time you come at it, you might probably need to restart a new goal (you can use the same name, it will continue and append to the history in ~/mentai/courses folder).
- Latency, it might take long to get responses from ChatGPT.
